    subtitle: Why amendment 17 is bad
    text: >
      We strongly oppose the proposed charter amendment to change redistricting
      procedures in Clark County. This amendment threatens the current system,
      which ensures a balance of political influence by distributing
      redistricting power across a diverse, bipartisan committee. The proposed
      changes would enable the controlling political party on the County Council
      to stack the redistricting committee in their favor, leading to biased
      district boundaries that serve their interests rather than those of the
      voters.

      The proposed amendment gives a false impression of reducing political
      manipulation in the redistricting process. In reality, it will result in
      increased political interference. By granting more direct control over the
      redistricting process to those in power, this amendment allows for greater
      potential abuse and gerrymandering, where district lines are drawn to
      benefit specific political agendas.

      Recent actions by County Council members underscore these concerns. They
      attempted to adopt a redistricting map that would have kept them within
      their districts, clearly using their positions for political gain. This
      example highlights the dangers of concentrating redistricting power in the
      hands of the Council. The current process, while not perfect, provides a
      more balanced and fair approach by minimizing the influence of any single
      political entity.

      Maintaining a fair and balanced redistricting process is essential for
      true representation. This amendment threatens that balance and opens the
      door to increased partisan manipulation. We urge voters to reject this
      amendment to preserve the integrity of our democratic processes. Vote NO
      on the proposed charter amendment to change redistricting procedures.
