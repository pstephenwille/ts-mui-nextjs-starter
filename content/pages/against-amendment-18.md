      The Washington Constitution firmly protects the people's right to
      petition, declaring that it "shall never be abridged." Yet, the proposed
      charter amendments threaten to erode this fundamental right, placing more
      power in the hands of government officials at the expense of ordinary
      citizens. These amendments, pushed by the County Auditor over the strong
      objections of engaged citizens, would drastically expand government
      oversight in ways that could stifle the initiative process and silence the
      voices of those who seek change.


      If these amendments pass, the Prosecuting Attorney would be granted
      unprecedented power to inject their legal opinions directly into petitions
      and ballots—an idea voters already rejected in 2022. The County Auditor
      would also gain new authority to estimate the costs of initiatives and
      impose strict form and style requirements on petitions. These changes are
      not about ensuring transparency; they are about creating roadblocks that
      could bias the process and discourage citizens from exercising their right
      to petition.


      The initiative process is a vital tool for self-governance, especially
      when elected officials fail to act on issues that matter to the people. By
      expanding the review powers of government officials beyond what state and
      federal law requires, these amendments would shift decision-making away
      from the public and into the hands of a select few. This is not about
      improving the system—it's about consolidating power and making it harder
      for grassroots efforts to succeed.


      These amendments represent a dangerous overreach by government officials
      and a direct threat to our democratic rights. To protect the people's
      voice and preserve the integrity of the initiative process, voters must
      reject these amendments.
