    text: "> Vote No to keep Clark County one of the most restrictive when it comes to allowing\n> citizens to petition for change. Washington state and Home Rule counties like Clark\n> reserve to the people the power of Referendum and Initiative as checks-and-balances\n> on laws and county policies. As of 2013, when the original charter was passed, only\n> 10 initiatives had been passed in the other home rule counties over 45 years. Only\n> one Mini Initiative has ever been attempted in Clark County. Clark County specifies\n> the shortest timeframe to file a referendum to a new ordnance – 10 days. This\n> Charter amendment does nothing to improve this unreasonably short deadline. By\n> comparison, other counties allow 45 days and the state allows 90 days. 10 days is not\n> long enough for all affected stakeholders to receive notification, to study the issue,\n> and to file notice. If this measure is passed, Clark County would still require twice\n> the percent of signatures required for a Washington state referendum.\_\n>\n> **Further, the**\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> **proposed requirement of a prosecuting attorney statement is another barrier to the**\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> **people’s voice, where a lone official could have an outsized effect on the measure.**\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> **This charter amendment does not substantially change the charter to favor the**\n>\n>\n>\n>\n> **people’s power to petition.**\n>\n> \_If you want an amendment that meets original intent,\n> Vote No until a more sincere version of this amendment is offered.\n> Statement against\n> and rebuttal of statement for submitted by:\n> Bob Runnells, chair\n>\n> George Hacker\_\n\n"
